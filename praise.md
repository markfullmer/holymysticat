<blockquote>"In this unique book you will encounter not only the sage Mysticat but also the creativity, erudition and mischievous humor of theologian, Rachel Adler. Through a close reading of her feline housemate's behavior, Adler connects us effortlessly to Jewish mysticism, rabbinic thought and a thousand bits of cherished tradition."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ever wonder what would happen if one of the fiercest feminist Jewish theological minds trained itself on understanding the mystical teachings of the soul of a <em>tzaddik</em> which had manifested itself in this world in her cat? Wonder no more. This piquant, entertaining, yet soulful and spiritual book is the result of that encounter. A book to be savored, like fine chocolate, or catnip."</blockquote>
--Rabbi Dr. Aryeh Cohen, Professor of Rabbinic Literature, Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies, American Jewish University and author of <em>Justice in the City: An Argument from the Sources of Rabbinic Judaism.</em>

<blockquote>"A delightful, first-person account of life with a great sage and mystical master. <em>The Mysticat</em> has deep Torah wisdom to impart, but only a fine mind like Rabbi Rachel Adler could interpret these arcane yet essential teachings for the rest of us."</blockquote>
--Rabbi Rachel Timoner, Senior Rabbi at Congregation Beth Elohim in Brooklyn and 
author of <em>Breath of Life: God as Spirit in Judaism.</em>

<blockquote>"Adler's Tales of the Holy Mysticat is an invaluable and tremendous contribution to Jewish thought. What at first may appear to be casual humor quickly reveals itself as profound wisdom teaching from one of the great rabbis of our time. Through beautiful, witty and precise language, Rabbi Adler instructs readers on many of Judaism's spiritual depths. Tales of the Holy Mysticat is a treasure that belongs on the bookshelf next to the great modern Jewish thinkers."</blockquote>
--Rabbi Jason Rodich, Rabbi at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco

<blockquote>"For those as curious as a cat (though you don't need to be a cat lover), this charming quirky book is destined to become a classic, cherished by those just beginning their Jewish journey to those who have been engaged in Jewish study their whole lives. It is an opportunity to explore Judaism with one of the most important Jewish teachers of our time (and her very special cat)."</blockquote>

Throughout the book, just when you settle in to enjoy some light whimsey, Adler strikes again with a profoundly insightful truth about the human (feline?) condition. Even avowed dog-lovers will relish this book!"</blockquote>
